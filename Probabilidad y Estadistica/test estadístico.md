**Statistical tests** are used in [hypothesis testing](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/hypothesis-testing/). They can be used to:

- determine whether a predictor variable has a statistically significant relationship with an outcome variable.
- estimate the difference between two or more groups.

Statistical tests assume a [null hypothesis](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/null-and-alternative-hypotheses/) of no relationship or no difference between groups. Then they determine whether the observed data fall outside of the range of values predicted by the null hypothesis.

## What is a null hypothesis?

The null hypothesis is the claim that there’s no effect in the population.

If the sample provides enough evidence against the claim that there’s no effect in the population (_p_ ≤ α), then we can [reject the null hypothesis](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/hypothesis-testing/#step-4-decide-whether-to-reject-or-fail-to-reject-your-null-hypothesis). Otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

Although “fail to reject” may sound awkward, it’s the only wording that statisticians [accept](https://www.scribbr.com/commonly-confused-words/accept-vs-except/). Be careful not to say you “prove” or “accept” the null hypothesis.

Example: Population on trial

Think of a statistical test as being like a legal trial. The population is accused of the “crime” of having an effect, and the sample is the criminal evidence. In the United States and many other countries, a person accused of a crime is assumed to be innocent until proven guilty. Similarly, we start by assuming the population is “innocent” of having an effect.

In other words, the null hypothesis (i.e., that there is no effect) is assumed to be true until the sample provides enough evidence to reject it.
## What does a statistical test do?

Statistical tests work by calculating a [**test statistic**](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/test-statistic/) – a number that describes how much the relationship between variables in your test differs from the null hypothesis of no relationship.

It then calculates a [**_p_ value**](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/p-value/) (probability value). The _p_-value estimates how likely it is that you would see the difference described by the test statistic if the null hypothesis of no relationship were true.

If the value of the test statistic is more extreme than the statistic calculated from the null hypothesis, then you can [infer](https://www.scribbr.com/commonly-confused-words/infer-vs-imply/#infer) a **[statistically significant](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/statistical-significance/) relationship** between the predictor and outcome variables.

If the value of the test statistic is less extreme than the one calculated from the null hypothesis, then you can infer **no statistically significant relationship** between the predictor and outcome variables.
