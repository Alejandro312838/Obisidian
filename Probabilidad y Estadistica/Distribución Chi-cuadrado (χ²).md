Very few real-world observations follow a chi-square distribution. The main purpose of chi-square distributions is hypothesis testing, not describing real-world distributions.

parametro k = degrees of freedom

Imagine taking a [random sample](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/simple-random-sampling/) of a standard normal distribution (_Z_). If you squared all the values in the sample, you would have the chi-square distribution with _k_ = 1.

Now imagine taking samples from two standard normal distributions (Z_1 and Z_2). If each time you sampled a pair of values, you squared them and added them together, you would have the chi-square distribution with _k_ = 2.

More generally, if you sample from _k_ independent standard normal distributions and then square and sum the values, youâ€™ll produce a chi-square distribution with _k_ degrees of freedom_._
